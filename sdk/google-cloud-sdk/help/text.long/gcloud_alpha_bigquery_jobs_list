DESCRIPTION

      (ALPHA) By default, jobs in the current project are listed; this can be
      overridden with the gcloud --project flag. The job ID, job type, state,
      start time, and duration of all jobs in the project are listed.

FLAGS

      --fingerprint-job-id

         Whether to use a job id that is derived from a fingerprint of the job
         configuration.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
