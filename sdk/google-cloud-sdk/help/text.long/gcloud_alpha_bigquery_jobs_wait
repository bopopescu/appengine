      [--fingerprint-job-id] [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--ignore-error]

DESCRIPTION

      (ALPHA) Waits up to a specified number of seconds for a specified job to
      finish.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      JOB_ID

         The job ID of the specified job. If this argument is omitted and there
         is exactly one running job, that job is used. It is an error if the
         argument is omitted and there is not exactly one running job.

FLAGS

      --changed-status-only

         When reporting the progress of the job being waited for, display only
         changes in status rather than reporting current status periodically.

      --ignore-error

         Do not exit the command with an error if the job finishes in an error
         state. (The default behavior is to exit with an error if the job
         finishes in an error state.)

      --max-wait MAX_WAIT

         The number of seconds after which execution of this command terminates
         even if the specified job has not finished. If not specified, this
         command waits until the specified job finishes.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --fingerprint-job-id

         Whether to use a job id that is derived from a fingerprint of the job
         configuration.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
