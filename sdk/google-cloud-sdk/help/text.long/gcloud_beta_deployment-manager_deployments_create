DESCRIPTION

      (BETA) This command inserts (creates) a new deployment based on a provided
      config file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      DEPLOYMENT_NAME

         Deployment name.

FLAGS

      --async

         Return immediately and print information about the Operation in
         progress rather than waiting for the Operation to complete.
         (default=False)

      --config CONFIG

         Filename of config which specifies resources to deploy.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         Optional description of the deployment to insert.

      --preview

         Preview the requested create without actually instantiating the
         underlying resources. (default=False)

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To create a new deployment, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment \
            --config config.yaml --description "My deployment"

      To preview a deployment without actually creating resources, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments create \
            my-new-deployment --config config.yaml --preview

      To instantiate a deployment that has been previewed, issue an update
      command for that deployment without specifying a config file.
