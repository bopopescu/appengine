      (BETA) This command will update a deployment with the new config file

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      DEPLOYMENT_NAME

         Deployment name.

FLAGS

      --async

         Return immediately and print information about the Operation in
         progress rather than waiting for the Operation to complete.
         (default=False)

      --config CONFIG

         Filename of config which specifies resources to deploy. Required unless
         launching an already-previewed update to this deployment.

      --create-policy CREATE_POLICY; default="CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE"

         Create policy for resources that have changed in the update. Can be
         CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE (default) or ACQUIRE.

      --delete-policy DELETE_POLICY; default="DELETE"

         Delete policy for resources that have changed in the update. Can be
         DELETE (default) or ABANDON.

      --preview

         Preview the requested update without making any changes to
         theunderlying resources. (default=False)

      --update-policy UPDATE_POLICY; default="PATCH"

         Update policy for resources that have changed in the update. Can be
         PATCH (default) or UPDATE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To update an existing deployment with a new config file, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml

      To preview an update to an existing deployment without actually modifying
      the resources, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --preview

      To apply an update that has been previewed, provide the name of the
      previewed deployment, and no config file:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment

      To specify different create, update, or delete policies, include any
      subset of the following flags;

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --create-policy ACQUIRE \
            --update-policy UPDATE --delete-policy ABANDON

      To perform an update without waiting for the operation to complete, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config new_config.yaml --async
