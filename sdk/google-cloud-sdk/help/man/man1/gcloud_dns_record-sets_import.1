.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command imports record\-sets contained within the specified record\-sets file into your managed\-zone\&. Note that NS records and the SOA NS field are not imported since name\-servers are managed by Cloud DNS\&. By default, record\-sets cannot be imported if there are any conflicts\&. A conflict exists if an existing record\-set has the same name and type as a record\-set that is being imported\&. In contrast, if the \-\-delete\-all\-existing flag is used, the imported record\-sets will replace all the records\-sets currently in the managed\-zone\&.
