FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      --transaction-file TRANSACTION_FILE; default="transaction.yaml"

         Path of the file which contains the transaction.

      --zone ZONE, -z ZONE

         Name of the managed-zone whose record-sets you want to manage.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
