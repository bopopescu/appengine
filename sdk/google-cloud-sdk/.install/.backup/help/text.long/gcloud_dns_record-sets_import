NAME

      gcloud dns record-sets import - import record-sets into your managed-zone

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud dns record-sets import RECORDS_FILE [--delete-all-existing]
      [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--log-http] [--project PROJECT_ID]
      [--quiet, -q] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [--zone ZONE, -z ZONE]
      [--zone-file-format] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command imports record-sets contained within the specified
      record-sets file into your managed-zone. Note that NS records and the SOA
      NS field are not imported since name-servers are managed by Cloud DNS. By
      default, record-sets cannot be imported if there are any conflicts. A
      conflict exists if an existing record-set has the same name and type as a
      record-set that is being imported. In contrast, if the
      --delete-all-existing flag is used, the imported record-sets will replace
      all the records-sets currently in the managed-zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      RECORDS_FILE

         File from which record-sets should be imported.

FLAGS

      --delete-all-existing

         Indicates that all existing record-sets should be deleted before
         importing the record-sets in the records-file.

      --zone-file-format

         Indicates that the records-file is in the zone file format.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      --zone ZONE, -z ZONE

         Name of the managed-zone whose record-sets you want to manage.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To import record-sets from a yaml record-sets file, run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE -z MANAGED_ZONE

      To import record-sets from a zone file, run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import ZONE_FILE --zone-file-format \
            -z MANAGED_ZONE

      To replace all the record-sets in your zone with records from a yaml file,
      run:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE \
            --delete-all-existing -z MANAGED_ZONE
