DESCRIPTION

      This command shows metadata for a Project, given a valid Project ID.

      This call can fail for the following reasons:

          * The project specified does not exist.
          * The active user does not have permission to access the given
            project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      ID

         Project ID

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      The following command will print metadata for a Project with identifier
      FOO-BAR-123

        $ gcloud projects describe FOO-BAR-123
