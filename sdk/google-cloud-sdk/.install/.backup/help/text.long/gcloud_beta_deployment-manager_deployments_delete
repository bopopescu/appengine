DESCRIPTION

      (BETA) This command deletes a deployment and deletes all associated
      resources.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      DEPLOYMENT_NAME [DEPLOYMENT_NAME ...]

         Deployment name.

FLAGS

      --async

         Return immediately and print information about the Operation in
         progress rather than waiting for the Operation to complete.
         (default=False)

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To delete several deployments, run:

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager deployments delete deployment-one \
            deployment-two deployment-three

      To disable the confirmation prompt on delete, run:
