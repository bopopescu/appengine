DESCRIPTION

      (ALPHA) A table or view reference in the query has the form

          dataset_name/table_or_view_name (for a dataset in the current project)
      or
          /project_name/dataset_name/table_or_view_name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      SQL_QUERY

         an SQL SELECT statement (typically in the form of a quoted string)

FLAGS

      --allow-large-results

         Enable larger --append-to or --write-to table sizes.

      --append-to APPEND_TO

         Name of a table to which query results will be appended.

      --async

         Create an asynchronous job to perform the query.

      --batch

         Run the query in batch mode.

      --dry-run

         Validate the query, but do not execute it.

      --job-id JOB_ID

         A unique job ID to use for the request.

      --limit LIMIT; default="100"

         How many rows to return in the result.

      --require-cache

         Run the query only if it is already cached.

      --start-row START_ROW

         First row to return in the result.

      --status STATUS; default="periodic"

         Whether the status of the query job should be reported periodically,
         every time the status changes, or not at all.

      --structured

         Preserve nested and repeated fields in the result schema. If not set,
         rows in the result are flattened.

      --use-cache

         Use the query cache to avoid rerunning cached queries.

      --write-to WRITE_TO

         Name of a table to which query results will be written (replacing the
         old contents of the table, if any).

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --fingerprint-job-id

         Whether to use a job id that is derived from a fingerprint of the job
         configuration.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
